# Create Audience Delivery

Once audience insights are generated, you can deliver these audiences to various partner platforms such as TradeDesk, LiveRamp, and others.

**Premium Feature**: This is a premium feature. If you donâ€™t have access and would like to enable it, please contact our sales team.

### Steps:

1. Open an existing conversation by selecting it from the **Recent** list or the **All Conversations** list.
2. Click on the **Audience Delivery** tab.
3. Enter the **Audience Name**. This name will be used to identify your audience delivery, so make it as unique as possible to avoid confusion.
4. Enter **Tags** to help group your audience delivery.
5. Select **Destinations** from the dropdown. This is where you want the audience data to be delivered. Depending on the selected destination, you may need to provide additional information such as the destination partner ID.
6. Click the **Submit** button. Once you submit, the status will change from Draft to **Approved**.
7. Any audience delivery with an **Approved** status will be sent to the destination. It takes a few hours to process and deliver the data. Check the status after some time. Once the data is delivered successfully, the status will change to **Processed**.
8. If you wish to cancel a data delivery, you can click the **Archive** button on the **Audience Delivery** tab.

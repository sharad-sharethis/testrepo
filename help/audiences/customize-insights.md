# Customize Insights

You can customize any insight, chart, or graph to fit your needs. Each insight includes options to download graphs, download data, and apply filters. There are multiple ways to display the data, including by index, percentage, or total. You can also view the data behind any graph by clicking the "Show data" button.

### Features:

1. **Changing Metrics**: 
   - Use the **"Show index"** dropdown to switch between different metrics such as **"Show percentage"** or **"Show total"**. By default, it is set to **"Show index"**.
   - **Show index** displays insights using the index (over-indexing) values. Over-indexing is a method used to compare a specific subset of data to the entire dataset.
      - For example: Let's consider a dataset of customers, where you're analyzing how many customers prefer a specific product category, say "Product A". You want to know whether "Millennials" are more likely to prefer "Product A" compared to the overall customer base. 
   - **Show percentage** presents insights based on percentage values.
   - **Show total** provides insights using the total (sum) values.

4. **Insights with Multiple Levels**: 
   - For insights that include multiple levels, such as **Category insights**, each level can be selected or deselected to fit your needs. 
   - For example, with **Category**, there are 3 levels:
     - **Level 1**: Food & Drink
     - **Level 2**: Food & Drink > Beverages
     - **Level 3**: Food & Drink > Beverages > Coffee & Tea
   - **Level 1** represents the broader, parent category. If you need more specific data, choose **Level 2** or **Level 3**.
   - Selecting levels using the checkbox will filter the data in the graph.
   - Level selection works alongside the actual data items selected under the **"Show data"** view. It is advisable to click **"Show data"** to ensure the appropriate data is selected for the graph.

   - Next to each category, there is a small **cloud icon**. Clicking this icon allows you to further drill into the category and see a word cloud of related topics / keywords. This feature helps in refining audience selection and insights. For example, topics displayed in word cloud can be applied manually in the audience definition.

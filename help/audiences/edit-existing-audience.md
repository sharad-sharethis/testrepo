# Edit Existing Audience

Follow the steps below to edit an existing audience on the Predactiv Platform.

1. **Smart Definition Toggle**  
   The AI will automatically define an audience. You can toggle this capability off using the "Smart definition" button.  
   - **Purpose**: The "Smart definition" feature allows the AI to adjust and tailor the best audience definition based on the conversation.

2. **Keyword Management**  
   Carefully examine the keywords to ensure they align with your target audience. Add or remove keywords as necessary:
   - **Add Keywords**: Use the "Similar suggested keywords" box or type directly into the keyword box.
   - **Remove Keywords**: Click the "x" next to any keyword you wish to remove.
   - As you edit, notice how the audience size changes on the 30-day scale at the top of the Audience Definition panel (e.g., 1.82M).

   - **IMPORTANT**: Specific audiences yield better insights. For example, the keyword "coffee" might be too broad if you're targeting an espresso drinks audience. Review and ensure your keywords are specific and relevant.

3. **Country Selection**  
   Edit the country or countries as needed:
   - **Remove a Country**: Click the "x" next to the country name.
   - **Add a Country**: Use the dropdown menu to select new countries or just start typing the country name.

2. **Enter your desired audience** into the text box at the bottom of the screen and press "Enter" key or small arrow icon. You can specify an interest, a brand, or even a region in your prompt. Below are a few example prompts:

3. **Predactiv Platform will generate the best result** utilizing data and AI RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). AI automatically selected the best keywords, defaulted the country to the United States, chose the best chart, and generated insights. It also suggested related keywords that can be applied to generate relevant insights.

4. **Request additional insights or charts** by asking for them in the prompt.  
For example: 
    - "Show me interest over time"

5. **Customize Insights** and graph. Refer to the [guide on customizing insights](/help/audiences/customize-insights) for more details.

**Note**: If you are happy with the Audience Definition section, including keywords and country, you can lock it by turning off "Smart definition" toggle switch. The purpose of the "Smart definition" feature is to allow the AI to automatically adjust and tailor the best audience definition based on the conversation.
